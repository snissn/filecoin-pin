**Store IPFS content on Filecoin's decentralized storage network with verifiable persistence.**

## Status

**Ready for persistent, verifiable data on Filecoin Mainnet.**

Register for updates and a later 2026 Q2 GA announcement at [filecoin.cloud](https://filecoin.cloud/).

## What is Filecoin Pin?

Filecoin Pin is a fully decentralized persistence layer for IPFS content using the global network of Filecoin storage providers with cryptographic guarantees.

When you use Filecoin Pin, your IPFS data gains:

- **Verifiable persistence** - Storage providers must cryptographically prove daily that they continue to store and serve your data
- **Economic incentives** - You only pay when storage proofs are successfully delivered and verified onchain
- **Decentralized infrastructure** - Your data can be stored across a global network of independent storage providers
- **Seamless IPFS integration** - Continue using standard [IPFS Mainnet](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/glossary/#mainnet) tooling (e.g., Kubo, Helia, HTTP Gateways) while gaining Filecoin's persistence guarantees
- **Sovereign data** - Choose your providers, audit storage proofs and payments onchain, with no dependency on a single company

## Who is Filecoin Pin for?

Filecoin Pin is designed for **developers building on IPFS** who need trustless, economically-incentivized persistence for their content. Whether you're building dApps, CI/CD workflows, static websites, AI agents, or other applications, Filecoin Pin provides the missing persistence layer for IPFS.

## Affordances

Filecoin Pin offers multiple affordances to integrate Filecoin storage into your workflow:

### 💻 CLI

### 📚 JavaScript Library
Use Filecoin Pin programmatically in your Node.js or browser applications. The library provides both a high-level API for common use cases and granular core modules for advanced customization.

- **Status**: Production-ready. Powers the CLI, GitHub Action, [filecoin-pin-website](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-pin-website), and [FOC dealbot](https://github.com/FilOzone/dealbot).
- **Repository**: This repo ([filecoin-project/filecoin-pin](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-pin))
- **Documentation**:
  - [API Reference](https://filecoin-project.github.io/filecoin-pin/) (TypeDoc-generated documentation)
  - High-level API: `import { … } from 'filecoin-pin'` (recommended for most use cases)
  - Core modules: `import { … } from 'filecoin-pin/core/*'` (CAR files, payments, Synapse SDK, uploads, UnixFS)
- **Installation**: `npm install --save filecoin-pin`

### 📡 IPFS Pinning Server (Daemon Mode)
Run a localhost IPFS Pinning Service API server that implements the [IPFS Pinning Service API specification](https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec/). This allows you to use standard IPFS tooling (like `ipfs pin remote`) while storing data on Filecoin.

- **Status**: ⚠️ **Beta — not intended for production use.** Works and is tested but does not yet have the resource controls or hardening required to safely serve untrusted (or even semi-trusted) callers. State is held in memory and is lost across restarts. Feature parity with the CLI is partial. If running a pinning server would benefit your use case, please comment on the [tracking issue](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-pin/issues/46) so we can prioritize.
- **Repository**: This repo (`filecoin-pin server` command in CLI)
- **Usage**: `PRIVATE_KEY=0x... ACCESS_TOKEN=... npx filecoin-pin server` (or use session key auth — see [Configuration](#configuration))
- **Authentication**: The server refuses to start unless an access token is configured via `--access-token` / `ACCESS_TOKEN`. Clients then authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request except `GET /`. To run the server open to all requests (not recommended), pass `--allow-no-auth` / `ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true`.
- **`delegates` is always empty**: Each pin spins up its own short-lived Helia node that is stopped as soon as the pin operation finishes, so there is no long-lived node to advertise. The `delegates` array in pin responses is therefore always `[]`.

#### ⚠️ Known limitations and operational guidance

The pinning server is currently safe to run only in trusted, single-operator environments. Specifically, **it does not enforce** any of the following:

- Per-request, per-user, or global rate limits on `POST /pins`
- Per-user quotas (active pins, total bytes pinned, transfer)
- Maximum DAG byte count, block count, or traversal depth
- Traversal timeout / `AbortController` on pin operations
- Concurrency cap across in-flight pin operations
- Filesystem quotas on the configured `CAR_STORAGE_PATH`

As a result, a single caller can submit a CID resolving to a very large DAG (or supply a reachable `origins` peer that serves one) and exhaust disk, network, CPU, or libp2p resources on the host. Hardening this surface is tracked in [#46](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-pin/issues/46) and will be a prerequisite for promoting the affordance out of beta.

Until then, operators should:

- **Bind to `localhost`** (the default) and never expose the daemon directly to the public internet.
- **Treat the `ACCESS_TOKEN` as a single-tenant secret.** Do not share it across users you don't fully trust to behave well; there's no per-token quota to contain misbehavior.
- **Do not enable `ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true`** outside of disposable local development.
- **Run on a host with bounded storage** (e.g., a dedicated volume) so a runaway pin can't take down other workloads on the same machine.

### 📊 Management Console GUI
Web-based management console for monitoring and managing your Filecoin Pin deployments. This is effectively a Web UI equivalent to the [CLI](#-cli) affordance.

- **Status**: Planned
- **Tracking**: See [issue #74](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-pin/issues/74) for updates. Please leave a comment about your use case if this would be particularly beneficial.

## Architecture

### The Big Picture

Filecoin Pin bridges IPFS and Filecoin to provide verifiable persistence for content-addressed data:

<img width="3840" height="2160" alt="Filecoin Pin Architecture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7bccef4-91d9-4733-8d48-9177b14e27b2" />

### Filecoin Pin Structure

This repository contains multiple affordances for user interaction and a shared library for consistent functionality:

<!-- Source: SVG exported from https://excalidraw.com/#room=1f613b355f33017ef481,u79JBN2E38noC8NpW8DkMQ -->
![Filecoin Pin Structure](documentation/assets/structure.svg)

The [Synapse SDK](https://synapse.filecoin.services/) is the main library, as it's doing the work of interfacing with the rest of [Filecoin Onchain Cloud](https://filecoin.cloud) including smart contracts, Filecoin Storage Providers, and more.

[Helia](https://helia.io/) is leveraged for turning files and directories into IPFS compatible data, which we output in [CAR format](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/carv1/).

The affordances were [discussed more above](#affordances).  All affordances use the same core library, ensuring consistent behavior and making it easy to add new interfaces in the future.

## Telemetry

Filecoin Pin collects telemetry.  A few things:
* Telemetry always [has a way to be disabled](#how-to-disable-telemetry).
* We don't collect Personal identifiable information (PII).
* Telemetry is enabled by default for the [affordances](#affordances), requiring a consumer/user to opt out.  We are defaulting as "enabled" to help make sure we have a good pulse on the user experience and can address issues correctly. Maintainers are particularly focused on validating functionality and ironing out problems throughout the whole Filecoin Onchain Cloud stack that `filecoin-pin` relies on.

What we collect:
* **Per-upload copy outcomes** posted directly to [BetterStack's HTTP metrics ingestion endpoint](https://betterstack.com/docs/logs/ingesting-data/http/metrics/), so we can measure the success rate of multi-copy uploads and identify which storage providers (or pipeline steps) are failing. See [`documentation/events-and-metrics.md`](documentation/events-and-metrics.md) for the full schema, including the underlying events and the relationship between this metric and the Synapse SDK's upload result.


  **Delivery model.** Each `executeUpload` fires its own HTTP POST containing one [`uploadCopyStatus`](documentation/events-and-metrics.md#uploadcopystatus) counter and one paired [`uploadCopyBytes`](documentation/events-and-metrics.md#uploadcopybytes) gauge per resolved copy outcome — there is no in-memory buffer or periodic flush. The CLI, pinning server, and GitHub Action `await flushTelemetry()` before exit so any in-flight request finishes. **Long-running consumers that terminate via `process.exit()`, `SIGINT`, or `SIGTERM` should do the same** (`flushTelemetry` is exported from `filecoin-pin/core/telemetry`). To silence subsequent `recordUploadResult` calls without exiting the process, call `configureTelemetry({ disabled: true })`.

  **Library usage (Node and browser).** The telemetry library never reads `process.env`. Configure it programmatically before the first `executeUpload` — the same API works in both runtimes:

  ```ts
  import { configureTelemetry } from 'filecoin-pin/core/telemetry'

  configureTelemetry({ disabled: true })                       // opt out
  configureTelemetry({ affordance: 'pin.filecoin.cloud' })   // tag the surface (default 'Library')
  ```

  The CLI's env-var support is built on top of this API (see `src/read-telemetry-config-from-env.ts`); other Node hosts can follow the same pattern.

### How to disable telemetry

- **CLI / pinning server / GitHub Action:** set `FILECOIN_PIN_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` (or the cross-tool standard `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`) in the host environment / workflow `env:` block. The Action also accepts `disableTelemetry: true` as an input; either signal silences telemetry.
- **Library consumers:** pass `{ disabled: true }` to `configureTelemetry()`.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24+** for CLI and library usage
- **Filecoin wallet** (Calibration testnet or Mainnet) with:
  - **For Calibration testnet:**
    - Test FIL for transaction gas ([Faucet](https://faucet.calibnet.chainsafe-fil.io/funds.html))
    - Test USDFC stablecoin for storage payments ([USDFC Faucet](https://forest-explorer.chainsafe.dev/faucet/calibnet_usdfc))
  - **For Mainnet:**
    - FIL for transaction gas
    - USDFC stablecoin for storage payments

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g filecoin-pin
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# 0. Set up authentication (choose one):
#    Private key:   export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
#                   (or pass --private-key <key> to each command)
#    Session key:   export WALLET_ADDRESS=0x... SESSION_KEY=0x...
#                   (or pass --wallet-address <addr> --session-key <key> to each command)
#    Revoke later:  filecoin-pin session revoke <session-address>

# 1. Configure payment permissions (one-time setup)
filecoin-pin payments setup --auto

# 2. Upload a file to Filecoin (defaults to Mainnet)
filecoin-pin add myfile.txt

# 3. Verify storage with cryptographic proofs
filecoin-pin data-set <dataset-id>

# To use Calibration testnet (not persistent) instead:
filecoin-pin add myfile.txt --network calibration
```

### Payment funding and experimental source acquisition

`payments setup --auto` uses the existing [Filecoin Pay](documentation/glossary.md#filecoin-pay) deposit and service-approval flow. On Calibration and local devnet, fund the owner wallet directly with [FIL](documentation/glossary.md#fil) for gas and [USDFC](documentation/glossary.md#usdfc) for the deposit:

```bash
filecoin-pin payments setup --auto --network calibration --deposit 1
filecoin-pin payments setup --auto --network devnet --deposit 1
```

On Filecoin mainnet only, the experimental, explicit opt-in acquisition can bring missing FIL and USDFC from the same owner address on Arbitrum One. The currently supported source is native Arbitrum USDC; it is intentionally an allowlist, not a generic bridge, and the funded mainnet release smoke remains pending:

```bash
# The maximum is a hard cap on source USDC for this run. Pick the smallest cap
# that covers the runtime quote; do not reuse this example as a budget.
filecoin-pin payments setup --auto --network mainnet --deposit 4 \
  --from-chain arb --from-token USDC --max-source-amount 10
```

`payments fund` supports both a fixed deposit target and a storage-runway target. Use direct Filecoin-side funding as the normal escape hatch/resume path after a completed acquisition:

```bash
# Direct Filecoin-side funding (Calibration/devnet, or resume after acquisition)
filecoin-pin payments fund --amount 2 --mode minimum --network calibration
filecoin-pin payments fund --days 30 --mode minimum --network devnet

# Experimental mainnet acquisition for a fixed deposit target
filecoin-pin payments fund --amount 4 --mode minimum --network mainnet \
  --from-chain arb --from-token USDC --max-source-amount 10
```

The source and Filecoin wallet must be controlled by the same private key. Keep Arbitrum native gas available for exact-amount ERC-20 approvals and route execution. `SOURCE_RPC_URL` is the Arbitrum RPC; set it and `SQUID_INTEGRATOR_ID` in the environment rather than command history. The examples above use `--network` with the default Filecoin endpoint. To use a custom Filecoin endpoint, omit `--network` and set `RPC_URL` instead; never set both selectors. Never put a wallet key, provider credential, or credential-bearing RPC URL in a script, issue, or artifact. Calibration and devnet intentionally fail acquisition closed: fund those wallets directly and retry. If an acquisition completed but a later Filecoin Pay step failed, rerun only the direct Filecoin deposit or `payments fund` command shown by the CLI; do not repeat source spending.

See the [payments acquisition route](documentation/payments-acquisition-route.md) for route caps, transaction stages, polling limits, and recovery, and the [release-evidence runbook](documentation/release-evidence/README.md) for safe evidence capture.

The release-evidence harness writes a private, ignored run artifact under `artifacts/release-evidence/` by default. Its exact dry-run commands, build prerequisite, and promotion rules are in the [release-evidence runbook](documentation/release-evidence/README.md). On POSIX the artifact is created with mode `0600`. Before any Windows mainnet run, choose an explicitly user-private output directory, restrict its ACL to the operator, and verify that another local user cannot read it. Review and sanitize an artifact before promoting only verified, non-sensitive facts into a curated versioned evidence record; do not commit raw run artifacts.

## Configuration

Configuration of the Filecoin Pin CLI can be performed either with arguments, or environment variables.

The Pinning Server requires the use of environment variables, as detailed below.

### Network Selection

Filecoin Pin supports **Mainnet**, **Calibration testnet**, and local **devnet** networks. By default, the CLI uses Mainnet.

**Using the CLI:**
```bash
# Use Mainnet (default)
filecoin-pin add myfile.txt

# Explicitly specify Mainnet
filecoin-pin add myfile.txt --network mainnet

# Use Calibration testnet
filecoin-pin add myfile.txt --network calibration

# Use a local foc-devnet (reads config from devnet-info.json, details below)
filecoin-pin add myfile.txt --network devnet
```

**Using environment variables:**
```bash
# Set network via environment variable
export NETWORK=mainnet
filecoin-pin add myfile.txt

# Or override RPC URL directly
export RPC_URL=wss://wss.node.glif.io/apigw/lotus/rpc/v1
filecoin-pin add myfile.txt
```

**Selection rules:**

* `--network` and `--rpc-url` (and their `NETWORK` / `RPC_URL` env equivalents) are mutually exclusive. Passing both is an error.
* When `--rpc-url` (or `RPC_URL`) is set, Filecoin Pin probes the endpoint's `eth_chainId` at startup and uses the matching chain (mainnet, calibration, or a configured devnet).
* When neither is set, Filecoin Pin defaults to Mainnet.

### Common CLI Arguments

* `-h`, `--help`: Display help information for each command
* `-V`, `--version`: Output the version number
* `-v`, `--verbose`: Verbose output
* `--private-key`: Ethereum-style (`0x`) private key (wallet and signer), funded with USDFC
* `--wallet-address`: Session key mode: owner wallet address
* `--session-key`: Session key mode: scoped signing key registered to the wallet
* `--network`: Filecoin network to use: `mainnet`, `calibration`, or `devnet` (default: `mainnet`). Mutually exclusive with `--rpc-url`.
* `--rpc-url`: Filecoin RPC endpoint. Filecoin Pin probes its `eth_chainId` to derive the chain. Mutually exclusive with `--network`.

Other arguments are possible for individual commands, use `--help` to find out more.

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...              # Ethereum private key with USDFC tokens

# Optional - Network Configuration
NETWORK=mainnet                # Network to use: mainnet, calibration, or devnet (default: mainnet)
RPC_URL=wss://...              # Filecoin RPC endpoint (overrides NETWORK if specified)
                               # Mainnet: wss://wss.node.glif.io/apigw/lotus/rpc/v1
                               # Calibration: wss://wss.calibration.node.glif.io/apigw/lotus/rpc/v1

# Optional - Mainnet source acquisition only (never needed on Calibration/devnet)
SOURCE_RPC_URL=https://...     # Arbitrum source-chain RPC; keep endpoint credentials out of shell history
SQUID_INTEGRATOR_ID=...        # Provider credential; never commit or print its value

# Optional for Pinning Server Daemon
ACCESS_TOKEN=...               # Bearer token required on all API requests except GET /
ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true             # Start without a token, serving all requests unauthenticated (not recommended)
PORT=3000                      # Daemon server port
HOST=127.0.0.1                 # Daemon server host
DATABASE_PATH=./pins.db        # SQLite database location
CAR_STORAGE_PATH=./cars        # CAR file storage directory
LOG_LEVEL=info                 # Logging verbosity (info, debug, error)

# Optional - Telemetry (see "Telemetry" above)
FILECOIN_PIN_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true        # Disable all telemetry
DO_NOT_TRACK=1                              # Standard cross-tool opt-out
```

### Default Data Directories

When `DATABASE_PATH` and `CAR_STORAGE_PATH` are not specified, data is stored in platform-specific locations:
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/filecoin-pin/`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/filecoin-pin/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/filecoin-pin/`

### Local Development with foc-devnet

When using `--network devnet`, Filecoin Pin reads connection details from a running [foc-devnet](https://github.com/filecoin-project/foc-devnet) instance:

- **Private key**: Automatically resolved from `devnet-info.json` (no `PRIVATE_KEY` needed)
- **RPC URL**: Read from the devnet chain configuration
- **Contract addresses**: Resolved from the devnet chain definition
- **IPNI verification**: Automatically skipped (no IPNI infrastructure on devnet)

**Environment variables for devnet:**

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `FOC_DEVNET_BASEDIR` | Override the foc-devnet base directory | `~/.foc-devnet` |
| `DEVNET_INFO_PATH` | Explicit path to `devnet-info.json` (overrides basedir) | `<basedir>/state/latest/devnet-info.json` |
| `DEVNET_USER_INDEX` | Which user from `devnet-info.json` to use | `0` |

## Development

Want to contribute to Filecoin Pin or run it locally? See
[DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for setup, scripts, debugging tips, HTTP
tracing, running against a local devnet, and working with an unpublished
`synapse-sdk` checkout.

Repository development uses `pnpm` workspaces. The published package can still
be installed with `npm`, `pnpm`, or other package managers.
